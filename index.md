our political systems are failing us  
noone believes our leaders will solve our problems  

and the far right winning  

the old model is broken  
nothing will change  

**until we fix it**

---

we are a collective of artists exploring the question of our time:

> what would real democracy look like?

~~representation~~ ≠ participation  
~~politics~~ ≠ people  
~~leaders~~ ≠ collective  
~~dependence~~ ≠ agency  
~~polarisation~~ ≠ community  
~~despair~~ ≠ hope

we  
believe in the power of creativity  
to shift culture

we make art, events and experiences  
we imagine how things could be different

to  
**create a vision of a future  
that people can believe in**
